Weather App Remake

Created in NextJS and used the weatherapi to gather data for the current and next 5 days.

Peer Reviewer - Ashur
Peer Review - the app is populating each days temperature high and lows; but the icons are not actual and not updating; favorites are working but not updating after adding or deleting the saved cities; the favs panel has to closed and opened again order to see the change.. however the app look greate it just need some work to correct small things.. good job
